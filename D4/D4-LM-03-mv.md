### **Lab Manual: Working with the `mv` Command in Linux**

The `mv` command in Linux is used to move files and directories from one location to another. It can also be used to rename files and directories. In this lab, you will go through several common scenarios of using the `mv` command for file and folder manipulation.

---

### **Scenario 1: Rename a File**

You can use the `mv` command to **rename** a file in the same directory.

#### **Command:**

```bash
mv old_filename.txt new_filename.txt
```

#### **Example:**

```bash
mv file1.txt renamed_file1.txt
```

- **Explanation:** This renames the file `file1.txt` to `renamed_file1.txt` in the current directory.

#### **Do:**
- Ensure the new file name does not conflict with any existing file in the same directory.
  
#### **Don't:**
- Do not use the `mv` command if the source and destination paths are the same and the file already exists, as this will overwrite the existing file.

---

### **Scenario 2: Move and Rename a File to Another Folder**

You can move a file to another directory and rename it in one step.

#### **Command:**

```bash
mv source_filename /path/to/destination/new_filename
```

#### **Example:**

```bash
mv renamed_file1.txt /home/user/documents/renamed_file2.txt
```

- **Explanation:** This moves `renamed_file1.txt` from the current directory to `/home/user/documents/` and renames it to `renamed_file2.txt` in the process.

#### **Do:**
- Ensure that the destination folder exists before moving the file.
  
#### **Don't:**
- Avoid moving files to a directory where a file with the same name already exists unless you intend to overwrite it.

---

### **Scenario 3: Move a File to a Folder (Without Renaming)**

You can move a file to another directory **without renaming** it by specifying the directory as the destination.

#### **Command:**

```bash
mv filename /path/to/destination/
```

#### **Example:**

```bash
mv renamed_file2.txt /home/user/backup/
```

- **Explanation:** This moves the file `renamed_file2.txt` to the `/home/user/backup/` directory while keeping the same file name.

#### **Do:**
- Ensure the target directory exists.
- Use tab completion or double-check the destination path to avoid errors.

#### **Don't:**
- Avoid moving files to a location where files with the same name already exist, as it will overwrite the file without warning unless you use the `-i` option for interactive prompts.

---

### **Scenario 4: Move a Folder**

You can move an entire folder and its contents to another location using the `mv` command.

#### **Command:**

```bash
mv folder_name /path/to/destination/
```

#### **Example:**

```bash
mv fold2 /home/user/documents/
```

- **Explanation:** This moves the entire directory `fold2` (including all files and subdirectories) to `/home/user/documents/`.

#### **Do:**
- Use this command carefully, as moving folders will relocate all contents.
- Ensure that the destination directory exists.
  
#### **Don't:**
- Do not forget to check if a folder with the same name exists in the target directory, as it will overwrite the existing directory or merge contents without warning.

### **Best Practices (Dos and Don’ts)**

#### **Dos:**
- **Use `-i` for Interactive Mode**: If you want to be prompted before overwriting files, use the `-i` option.
  
  ```bash
  mv -i filename /path/to/destination/
  ```

- **Use Absolute Paths**: It's often safer to use absolute paths to avoid confusion when moving files between directories.
  
- **Check for Overwrites**: Be cautious of overwriting files unintentionally. You can use the `-n` option to prevent `mv` from overwriting existing files:

  ```bash
  mv -n filename /path/to/destination/
  ```

#### **Don'ts:**
- **Don’t Forget Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to move or rename files and directories. You might need to use `sudo` for system files.
  
- **Don’t Move System or Important Files Carelessly**: Be careful when moving important system files or directories, as this could cause issues in the functioning of your system.

- **Don’t Forget About Hidden Files**: If moving a directory, be aware that hidden files (starting with a dot `.`) will also be moved, unless they are excluded explicitly.

### **Summary of Commands:**

1. **Rename a file:**
   ```bash
   mv old_filename.txt new_filename.txt
   ```

2. **Move and rename a file:**
   ```bash
   mv source_filename /path/to/destination/new_filename
   ```

3. **Move a file to a folder (without renaming):**
   ```bash
   mv filename /path/to/destination/
   ```

4. **Move a folder:**
   ```bash
   mv folder_name /path/to/destination/
   ```
