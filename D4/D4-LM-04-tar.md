### **Lab Manual: Working with Tar Archives in Linux**

This lab will guide you through a series of tasks that involve creating, extracting, and managing tar archives in Linux. The steps below are based on common scenarios where you want to archive a folder, extract contents to a specific location, and manage files inside and outside of the archives.

---

### **1. Create Directories and Archive a Folder**

#### **Step 1: Create a Directory and Files**

Start by creating a directory named `fold2` and add some sample files into it.

```bash
mkdir fold2
touch fold2/file1.txt fold2/file2.txt
```

This directory now contains two files: `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.

#### **Step 2: Archive the Contents of the Folder**

To archive all the files inside `fold2` without including the folder itself, use the following command:

```bash
tar -cvf fold2.tar fold2/*
```

- This command creates an archive `fold2.tar` containing only the files from `fold2` (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`), not the folder itself.

#### **Step 3: Extract the Archive into a New Folder**

Next, create a new folder called `fold3` and extract the contents of `fold2.tar` into this folder:

```bash
mkdir fold3
tar -xvf fold2.tar -C fold3
```

- The `-C fold3` option ensures that the archive is extracted into `fold3`.

#### **Step 4: Verify the Contents of `fold3`**

After extraction, verify the contents of `fold3`:

```bash
ls -l fold3
```

You should see `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` inside the `fold3` directory.

### **2. Managing Archives and Extracting Files**

#### **Step 5: Archive a Folder with All Its Contents**

Now, archive the entire `fold2` folder, including subdirectories and files:

```bash
tar -cvf fold-c.tar fold2/
```

- This command creates `fold-c.tar`, including the folder `fold2` and its entire contents.

#### **Step 6: Extract the Archive into Another Folder**

Extract the contents of `fold-c.tar` into `fold3` again:

```bash
tar -xvf fold-c.tar -C fold3
```

Check the contents of `fold3` to confirm that `fold2` has been extracted as a subdirectory of `fold3`:

```bash
ls -l fold3
```

You should now see `fold2` inside `fold3`.

### **3. Cleaning Up and Re-Extracting**

#### **Step 7: Remove Subdirectory and Re-Extract**

Let’s remove the `fold2` subdirectory from `fold3`:

```bash
rm -r fold3/fold2
```

After deleting, verify that `fold2` has been removed:

```bash
ls -l fold3
```

Re-extract `fold-c.tar` into `fold3` again:

```bash
tar -xvf fold-c.tar -C fold3
```

Verify the contents:

```bash
ls -l fold3
```

You should see `fold2` back inside `fold3`.

---

### **4. Advanced Archive Creation**

#### **Step 8: Archive Only the Contents of a Folder (Without Folder)**

To create an archive of the **contents** of `fold2` without including the folder itself, you can run:

```bash
tar -cvf fold-2.tar -C fold2 .
```

This command archives the files **inside** `fold2` but doesn’t include the `fold2` folder itself in the archive.

#### **Step 9: Extract Specific Files to a New Location**

Extract specific files from the archive to another directory (`fold3`):

```bash
tar -xvf fold-2.tar -C fold3
```

Verify that the files from `fold2` have been extracted into `fold3`:

```bash
ls -l fold3
```

---

### **5. Extracting Archives and Path Handling**

#### **Step 10: Extract Files from Inside a Subdirectory**

Let’s say you want to extract the contents of `fold-3.tar` (which you created earlier) into `fold3`. First, move to the parent directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

Then extract the archive into `fold3`:

```bash
tar -xvf fold2/fold-3.tar -C fold3
```

Verify the contents of `fold3`:

```bash
ls -l fold3
```

### **Summary**

In this lab, you’ve learned how to:

- Archive a directory with or without including the folder itself.
- Extract files into specific directories.
- Manage archives and remove/extract files to and from different locations.
- Use options like `-C` to control where files are extracted.

These commands form the basis for file management using tar in Linux, allowing you to efficiently create, manipulate, and extract archives in various scenarios.
