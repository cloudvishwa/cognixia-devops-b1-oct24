To install the **Az module** (Azure PowerShell) on your machine, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
Make sure you run PowerShell with administrative privileges to install the module.

### Step 2: Install the Az Module
Run the following command to install the Az module:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Explanation:
- `-Name Az`: Specifies the name of the module to install.
- `-AllowClobber`: This allows any conflicting commands from other modules to be overridden by Az commands.
- `-Scope CurrentUser`: Installs the module for the current user without requiring administrator rights to write to system folders. You can omit this if you're running PowerShell as an administrator.

### Step 3: Confirm Installation
You might be prompted to confirm installation from an untrusted repository. Type `Y` or `A` to confirm and proceed with the installation.

```powershell
Do you want to install modules from 'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
```

Choose `Y` or `A` to proceed.

### Step 4: Verify Installation
After the installation completes, you can verify that the **Az module** is installed by running:

```powershell
Get-Module -Name Az -ListAvailable
```

This command will list all available versions of the Az module.

### Step 5: Import the Az Module
If you want to start using the Az module in your current session, you can import it by running:

```powershell
Import-Module Az
```

### Step 6: Connect to Azure
To connect to your Azure account and start managing resources:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

This will prompt you to authenticate to Azure using your credentials.
