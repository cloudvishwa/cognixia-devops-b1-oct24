Here are some examples of how to work with arrays in PowerShell, as demonstrated in the image:

---

### Example 1: **Creating an Array**
```powershell
$Names = @('Adam', 'Bob', 'Bill')
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This creates an array named `$Names` containing three elements: `'Adam'`, `'Bob'`, and `'Bill'`.
  - The `@()` syntax is used to initialize an array in PowerShell.
  - **Use Case**: Arrays are useful when you need to store and work with multiple values in a single variable.

---

### Example 2: **Adding an Element to an Array**
```powershell
$Names += 'John'
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `+=` operator appends `'John'` to the existing `$Names` array.
  - After this operation, the array will contain four elements: `('Adam', 'Bob', 'Bill', 'John')`.
  - **Use Case**: This demonstrates how to dynamically add elements to an array.

---

### Example 3: **Getting the Length of an Array**
```powershell
$Names.Length
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `.Length` property of an array returns the number of elements in the array.
  - For the `$Names` array (after appending `'John'`), this would return `4`.
  - **Use Case**: This is useful when you need to know how many elements are in an array, especially when working with loops or conditions.

---

### Example 4: **Iterating Through an Array**
```powershell
foreach ($Name in $Names) {
    Write-Output $Name
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This `foreach` loop iterates over each element in the `$Names` array.
  - For each `$Name` in the array, it outputs the value (`'Adam'`, `'Bob'`, `'Bill'`, `'John'`).
  - **Use Case**: This is helpful when you need to perform operations on each element of an array.

---

### Example 5: **Accessing an Array Element by Index**
```powershell
$Names[0]
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This accesses the first element in the `$Names` array (index `0`), which is `'Adam'`.
  - **Use Case**: Arrays in PowerShell are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index `0`. This is useful when you need to access specific elements in an array.

---

### Example 6: **Modifying an Element in an Array**
```powershell
$Names[1] = 'Robert'
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This modifies the second element (index `1`) of the `$Names` array from `'Bob'` to `'Robert'`.
  - After this, the array will be `('Adam', 'Robert', 'Bill', 'John')`.
  - **Use Case**: This allows you to change specific elements in an array after initialization.

---

### Example 7: **Removing an Element from an Array**
```powershell
$Names = $Names | Where-Object { $_ -ne 'Bill' }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This filters the `$Names` array and removes the element `'Bill'`.
  - The `Where-Object` cmdlet is used to create a new array that contains all elements except `'Bill'`.
  - **Use Case**: Removing items from an array dynamically based on conditions.

These examples show common array operations in PowerShell, such as creating arrays, adding/removing elements, iterating through arrays, and accessing/modifying elements.
