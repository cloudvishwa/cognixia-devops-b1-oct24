Here are some combined examples that utilize `if`, `else`, and the comparison operators (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-gt`, `-match`, `-like`, `-Contains`) from the previous examples:

---

### Example 1: **Checking Equality and Inequality**
```powershell
$person = 'Adam'

if ($person -eq 'Adam') {
    Write-Output "Hello, Adam!"
} elseif ($person -ne 'Bob') {
    Write-Output "You are not Bob."
} else {
    Write-Output "Unknown person."
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This `if` statement checks if `$person` is `'Adam'`, and if true, it outputs a greeting.
  - If `$person` is not `'Adam'` but also not `'Bob'`, it outputs "You are not Bob."
  - If neither condition matches, it prints "Unknown person."

---

### Example 2: **Combining Numeric Comparisons with If-Else**
```powershell
$number = 5

if ($number -lt 10) {
    Write-Output "$number is less than 10"
} elseif ($number -gt 10) {
    Write-Output "$number is greater than 10"
} else {
    Write-Output "$number is exactly 10"
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This `if` statement checks if the number is less than, greater than, or exactly equal to `10`.

---

### Example 3: **Pattern Matching with `-match` and `-like` in If-Else**
```powershell
$name = 'Adam'

if ($name -match 'Ad') {
    Write-Output "$name matches the pattern 'Ad'"
} elseif ($name -like 'A*') {
    Write-Output "$name starts with 'A'"
} else {
    Write-Output "$name does not match the patterns"
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This example uses `-match` to check if `$name` contains `'Ad'` and `-like` to check if it starts with `'A'`.
  - If neither condition is met, it outputs that no patterns were matched.

---

### Example 4: **Array Containment with `-Contains` in If-Else**
```powershell
$names = @('Adam', 'Bob', 'Bill')
$checkName = 'Bob'

if ($names -Contains $checkName) {
    Write-Output "$checkName is in the array."
} else {
    Write-Output "$checkName is not in the array."
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This example checks if the array `$names` contains the value stored in `$checkName`.
  - If it does, it outputs that `$checkName` is in the array, otherwise, it outputs that it is not.

---

### Example 5: **Combining Numeric and String Comparison with If-Else**
```powershell
$age = 25
$name = 'Adam'

if ($age -lt 30 -and $name -eq 'Adam') {
    Write-Output "$name is younger than 30"
} elseif ($age -ge 30 -or $name -ne 'Adam') {
    Write-Output "$name is not Adam or is older than 30"
} else {
    Write-Output "Neither condition is met"
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This combines numeric and string comparisons with the logical `-and` and `-or` operators.
  - The first condition checks if `$age` is less than 30 and `$name` is `'Adam'`.
  - The second condition uses `-or` to check if `$age` is greater than or equal to 30, or if `$name` is not `'Adam'`.

---

### Example 6: **If-Else with Nested Comparison Operators**
```powershell
$numbers = @(5, 10, 15)
$input = 10

if ($numbers -Contains $input) {
    if ($input -lt 10) {
        Write-Output "$input is in the array and less than 10"
    } elseif ($input -eq 10) {
        Write-Output "$input is exactly 10 and in the array"
    } else {
        Write-Output "$input is in the array and greater than 10"
    }
} else {
    Write-Output "$input is not in the array"
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This example checks if `$input` is in the array `$numbers`.
  - If it is, it performs further checks to see whether `$input` is less than, equal to, or greater than 10.
  - If `$input` is not in the array, it outputs a different message.

These examples demonstrate combining `if` and `else` statements with different comparison operators (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-gt`, `-match`, `-like`, `-Contains`) in various scenarios to create complex logic.
