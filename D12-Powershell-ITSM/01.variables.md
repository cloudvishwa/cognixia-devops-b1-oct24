Here are examples of using strings in PowerShell, along with output that demonstrates variable use and different string types (literal, expandable, and here-strings):

---

### Example 1: **Literal String**
```powershell
$Name = 'Literal String'
Write-Output $Name
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This is a literal string, meaning it does not interpret variables or special characters.
  - The output will simply be:
  
```
Literal String
```

---

### Example 2: **Expandable String**
```powershell
$Name = "John"
$Greeting = "Hello, $Name!"
Write-Output $Greeting
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This is an expandable string, meaning variables inside double quotes are expanded and their values are inserted.
  - The output will be:
  
```
Hello, John!
```

---

### Example 3: **Using Variables in Strings**
```powershell
$FirstName = "Jane"
$LastName = "Doe"
$FullName = "Full Name: $FirstName $LastName"
Write-Output $FullName
```
- **Explanation**:
  - In this expandable string, both `$FirstName` and `$LastName` variables are expanded and inserted into the string.
  - The output will be:
  
```
Full Name: Jane Doe
```

---

### Example 4: **Here-String (Preserving New Lines)**
```powershell
$multiLineString = @'
This is a here-string.
It preserves
new line characters.
'@
Write-Output $multiLineString
```
- **Explanation**:
  - A here-string preserves the formatting, including line breaks.
  - The output will be:
  
```
This is a here-string.
It preserves
new line characters.
```

---

### Example 5: **Combining Literal and Expandable Strings**
```powershell
$Name = "Alice"
Write-Output 'This is a literal string: $Name'
Write-Output "This is an expandable string: $Name"
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The first `Write-Output` uses single quotes, so `$Name` is treated as literal text, not expanded.
  - The second `Write-Output` uses double quotes, so `$Name` is expanded to its value (`"Alice"`).
  - The output will be:
  
```
This is a literal string: $Name
This is an expandable string: Alice
```

---

### Example 6: **Combining Variables and Here-Strings**
```powershell
$Name = "Bob"
$multiLineGreeting = @"
Hello, $Name
Welcome to the PowerShell session.
Enjoy your time!
"@
Write-Output $multiLineGreeting
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This here-string allows for variable expansion and maintains new line formatting.
  - The output will be:
  
```
Hello, Bob
Welcome to the PowerShell session.
Enjoy your time!
```

These examples show how PowerShell handles literal strings, expandable strings, and here-strings, and how you can use variables within each.
