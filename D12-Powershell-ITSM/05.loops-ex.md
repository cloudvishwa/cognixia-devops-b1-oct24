Here are some examples of how to use different loop structures in PowerShell, as shown in the image:

---

### Example 1: **`foreach` Loop**
```powershell
$Processes = Get-Process
foreach ($Process in $Processes) {
    $Process.Id
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This loop iterates over all processes retrieved by `Get-Process`.
  - For each `$Process`, it outputs the process ID (`$Process.Id`).
  - **Use Case**: This is useful when you want to perform an operation on each item in a collection, such as listing all process IDs.

---

### Example 2: **`while` Loop**
```powershell
$i = 0
while ($i -lt 10) {
    Write-Output $i
    $i++
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `while` loop runs as long as the condition `$i -lt 10` (i.e., `$i` is less than 10) is true.
  - During each iteration, it prints the value of `$i` and then increments `$i` by 1.
  - **Use Case**: This loop is good for when you donâ€™t know exactly how many iterations you need, but you want the loop to continue until a certain condition is met.

---

### Example 3: **`for` Loop**
```powershell
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 10; $i++) {
    Write-Output $i
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `for` loop initializes `$i` to 0, runs as long as `$i` is less than 10, and increments `$i` after each iteration.
  - It prints the value of `$i` on each iteration.
  - **Use Case**: The `for` loop is typically used when you know exactly how many iterations are needed (in this case, 10 iterations).

---

### Example 4: **`foreach` with Object Properties**
```powershell
$Services = Get-Service
foreach ($Service in $Services) {
    Write-Output $Service.Name
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This loop iterates over all services retrieved by `Get-Service` and prints the name of each service (`$Service.Name`).
  - **Use Case**: Useful for operations that need to access specific properties of each object in a collection, such as listing the names of all services.

---

### Example 5: **Combining Loops with Conditional Logic**
```powershell
for ($i = 0; $i -lt 10; $i++) {
    if ($i % 2 -eq 0) {
        Write-Output "$i is even"
    } else {
        Write-Output "$i is odd"
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This `for` loop prints whether the current value of `$i` is even or odd.
  - **Use Case**: This demonstrates using a loop with conditional logic for more advanced iteration tasks.

These examples cover common scenarios where loops are used in PowerShell to iterate through data, perform operations repeatedly, or apply conditions while looping.
