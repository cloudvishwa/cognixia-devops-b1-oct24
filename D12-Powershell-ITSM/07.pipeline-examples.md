Here are some examples of pipelines in PowerShell to demonstrate chaining commands together, simplifying looping, and dealing with sets of objects:

---

### Example 1: **Basic Command Chaining**
```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU | Select-Object -First 5
```
- **Explanation**: 
  - This pipeline fetches all running processes using `Get-Process`.
  - The output is sorted by CPU usage using `Sort-Object`.
  - Finally, `Select-Object` is used to retrieve the top 5 processes with the highest CPU usage.

---

### Example 2: **Filtering Objects in a Pipeline**
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Running' }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This retrieves all services using `Get-Service`.
  - `Where-Object` is used to filter only services that are currently running (`Status` equals 'Running').
  - The `$_` represents the current object in the pipeline.

---

### Example 3: **Looping Through Files with a Pipeline**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Logs" | ForEach-Object { $_.FullName }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This pipeline lists all files in the "C:\Logs" directory.
  - `ForEach-Object` processes each file and outputs its full path (`FullName`).
  - This eliminates the need for a `foreach` loop when iterating over the files.

---

### Example 4: **Exporting Data from a Pipeline**
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 100 } | Export-Csv -Path "HighCPUProcesses.csv"
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This retrieves all processes and filters only those using more than 100 CPU units.
  - The output is then exported to a CSV file using `Export-Csv`.

---

### Example 5: **Working with Services and Stopping Them**
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Running' } | Stop-Service
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This pipeline retrieves all services, filters the ones that are running, and stops them.
  - It simplifies the process of managing multiple services without needing a manual loop.

These examples illustrate how pipelines make handling objects in PowerShell simpler, more efficient, and easier to read by chaining commands together.
