Here are some examples of working with objects in PowerShell to demonstrate how objects have properties, methods, and can be formatted, filtered, and extended:

---

### Example 1: **Accessing Object Properties**
```powershell
Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU, Id
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This command retrieves a list of all processes using `Get-Process`.
  - The `Select-Object` cmdlet is used to display only the `Name`, `CPU`, and `Id` properties of each process.
  - It demonstrates how you can access specific properties of an object.

---

### Example 2: **Invoking Object Methods**
```powershell
(Get-Date).AddDays(5)
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `Get-Date` cmdlet retrieves the current date and time, which is an object of type `DateTime`.
  - Using the `AddDays()` method of the `DateTime` object, 5 days are added to the current date.
  - This showcases how methods can be used to manipulate objects.

---

### Example 3: **Filtering Objects Based on Properties**
```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Running' }
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This command lists all the services on the system using `Get-Service`.
  - `Where-Object` filters the results and returns only those services whose `Status` property equals `'Running'`.
  - This example demonstrates filtering objects based on their properties.

---

### Example 4: **Formatting Objects**
```powershell
Get-Process | Format-Table -Property Name, CPU, StartTime -AutoSize
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This command retrieves all processes using `Get-Process` and formats the output into a table.
  - `Format-Table` organizes the output based on the specified properties (`Name`, `CPU`, `StartTime`) and adjusts the table size automatically with `-AutoSize`.
  - It demonstrates formatting objects for better readability.

---

### Example 5: **Extending an Object (Adding a Custom Property)**
```powershell
Get-Process | Select-Object Name, CPU, @{Name='IsHighCPU'; Expression={if ($_.CPU -gt 100) {'Yes'} else {'No'}}}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This command retrieves processes and adds a custom property called `IsHighCPU`.
  - The custom property evaluates whether a process is using more than 100 CPU units. If it is, it adds "Yes"; otherwise, "No".
  - This demonstrates how objects can be extended with new, calculated properties.

---

### Example 6: **Piping Objects and Exporting Results**
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CPU -gt 50 } | Export-Csv -Path "HighCPUProcesses.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This retrieves processes using `Get-Process`, filters those consuming more than 50 CPU units, and exports the result to a CSV file.
  - This example combines filtering objects and exporting them for further use.

These examples illustrate how objects in PowerShell can be accessed, filtered, formatted, and extended using properties and methods. Each example demonstrates a different aspect of working with objects in PowerShell to automate and streamline tasks.
