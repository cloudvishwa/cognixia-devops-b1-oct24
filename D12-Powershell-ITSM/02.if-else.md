Here’s an example of an `if`, `elseif`, and `else` structure with printouts based on some conditions, similar to what is shown in the image:

---

### Example 1: **Checking Computer and User Conditions**
```powershell
$IsComputer = $true
$IsUser = $false

if ($IsComputer) {
    Write-Output "This is a Computer."
} elseif ($IsUser) {
    Write-Output "This is a User."
} else {
    Write-Output "Unknown entity."
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - If `$IsComputer` is `$true`, it will print `"This is a Computer."`
  - If `$IsUser` is `$true` and `$IsComputer` is `$false`, it will print `"This is a User."`
  - If neither condition is met, it will print `"Unknown entity."`

---

### Example 2: **Comparison with If-Else and Printouts**
```powershell
$age = 25
$name = "John"

if ($age -gt 18 -and $name -eq "John") {
    Write-Output "John is older than 18."
} elseif ($age -lt 18 -and $name -ne "John") {
    Write-Output "This is not John and the person is younger than 18."
} else {
    Write-Output "Person does not match the conditions."
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - If the `$age` is greater than 18 and `$name` is `"John"`, it prints `"John is older than 18."`
  - If `$age` is less than 18 and `$name` is not `"John"`, it prints `"This is not John and the person is younger than 18."`
  - If neither condition matches, it prints `"Person does not match the conditions."`

---

### Example 3: **Checking Strings and Numbers with Printouts**
```powershell
$temperature = 85

if ($temperature -gt 100) {
    Write-Output "It’s too hot!"
} elseif ($temperature -lt 60) {
    Write-Output "It’s too cold!"
} else {
    Write-Output "The temperature is just right."
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This example checks the value of `$temperature`.
  - If `$temperature` is greater than 100, it prints `"It’s too hot!"`
  - If `$temperature` is less than 60, it prints `"It’s too cold!"`
  - If neither condition is met, it prints `"The temperature is just right."`

---

### Example 4: **Array and String Check with If-Else**
```powershell
$names = @('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie')
$inputName = "Bob"

if ($names -Contains $inputName) {
    Write-Output "$inputName is in the list of names."
} else {
    Write-Output "$inputName is not in the list of names."
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This example checks if `$inputName` (`"Bob"`) is part of the `$names` array.
  - If it is, it prints that the name is in the list. Otherwise, it prints that the name is not found.

These examples demonstrate how you can use `if`, `elseif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of a PowerShell script based on conditions and provide meaningful output based on the results.
