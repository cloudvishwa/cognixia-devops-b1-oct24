Lab 06 - Implement Traffic Management
Lab Objectives: In this lab, you will explore how to manage Azure Storage effectively, with hands-on tasks to evaluate and implement key features like blob storage management, file shares, and security. The lab helps you understand Azure's cost optimization strategies for less frequently accessed data and explores protection mechanisms for ensuring secure and compliant data storage.

Job skills
Task 1: Use a template to provision an infrastructure.
Task 2: Configure an Azure Load Balancer.
Task 3: Configure an Azure Application Gateway.

Task 1: Use a template to provision an infrastructure
In this task, you will use a template to deploy one virtual network, one network security group, and two virtual machines.

Task 2: Configure an Azure Load Balancer
In this task, you implement an Azure Load Balancer in front of the two Azure virtual machines in the virtual network. Load Balancers in Azure provide layer 4 connectivity across resources, such as virtual machines. Load Balancer configuration includes a front-end IP address to accept connections, a backend pool, and rules that define how connections should traverse the load balancer.


Task 3: Configure an Azure Application Gateway
In this task, you implement an Azure Application Gateway in front of two Azure virtual machines. An Application Gateway provides layer 7 load balancing, Web Application Firewall (WAF), SSL termination, and end-to-end encryption to the resources defined in the backend pool. The Application Gateway routes images to one virtual machine and videos to the other virtual machine.
