This YAML file creates a **Kubernetes Deployment** and a **Service**. Below is an explanation of each section:

---

### **Deployment Explanation**
#### `apiVersion: apps/v1`
Specifies the API version for the Deployment resource.

#### `kind: Deployment`
Defines the resource type as a Deployment.

#### `metadata`
- **`name: nginx-1`**: The name of the Deployment.
- **`labels: app: nginx-dep`**: Metadata labels for organizing and identifying resources.

#### `spec`
- **`replicas: 3`**: Specifies that 3 Pod replicas will be created and managed.
- **`selector: matchLabels: app: nginx-pod`**: Ensures that this Deployment manages only Pods with the label `app: nginx-pod`.

#### `template`
- **`metadata: labels: app: nginx-pod`**: Specifies labels for Pods created by this Deployment.
- **`spec: containers`**:
  - **`name: nginx`**: The first container in each Pod runs Nginx.
    - **`image: nginx:latest`**: Specifies the Docker image for Nginx.
    - **`ports: containerPort: 80`**: The Nginx container listens on port `80`.
  - **`name: redis`**: The second container in each Pod runs Redis.
    - **`image: redis`**: Specifies the Docker image for Redis.
    - **`ports: containerPort: 6379`**: The Redis container listens on port `6379`.

### **Service Explanation**
#### `apiVersion: v1`
Specifies the API version for the Service resource.

#### `kind: Service`
Defines the resource type as a Service.

#### `metadata`
- **`name: nginx-service`**: The name of the Service.
- **`labels: app: nginx-dep`**: Metadata labels for the Service.

#### `spec`
- **`type: NodePort`**: Exposes the Service externally through a NodePort, allowing external access.
- **`selector: app: nginx-pod`**: Matches the Pods with the label `app: nginx-pod` to connect them to this Service.
- **`ports`**: Defines the ports exposed by the Service:
  - **Nginx Port**:
    - **`name: nginx`**: Name of the port.
    - **`protocol: TCP`**: Specifies TCP protocol.
    - **`port: 80`**: The port on which the Service is exposed internally within the cluster.
    - **`targetPort: 80`**: Routes traffic to the container's port `80` (Nginx).
    - **`nodePort: 30007`**: Exposes the Service on port `30007` on each Node for external access.
  - **Redis Port**:
    - **`name: redis`**: Name of the port.
    - **`protocol: TCP`**: Specifies TCP protocol.
    - **`port: 6379`**: The port on which the Service is exposed internally within the cluster.
    - **`targetPort: 6379`**: Routes traffic to the container's port `6379` (Redis).

### **How it Works**
1. **Deployment**:
   - Creates 3 replicas of Pods, each containing:
     - One Nginx container listening on port `80`.
     - One Redis container listening on port `6379`.

2. **Service**:
   - Exposes the Pods with the label `app: nginx-pod` via:
     - **Nginx (port 80)**:
       - Internally exposed on port `80`.
       - Externally accessible on NodePort `30007`.
     - **Redis (port 6379)**:
       - Internally exposed on port `6379`.

3. **Traffic Flow**:
   - Requests to `http://<NodeIP>:30007` are routed to the Nginx container in one of the Pods.
   - Redis is available internally to other Kubernetes resources using the `nginx-service` name on port `6379`.

---

### **Usage**
- Access Nginx from outside the cluster via `http://<NodeIP>:30007`. ( In out example the NODE IP would minikube IP)
- Redis is accessible internally within the cluster using `nginx-service:6379`.

This setup creates a single Service for both Nginx and Redis, sharing the same selector (`app: nginx-pod`) but differentiating traffic based on ports.
